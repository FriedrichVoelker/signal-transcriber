# Signal-Transcriber

A Program to automatically take Voice Messagses from Signal and transcribing them to text using openais Whisper

Heavily relys on [signal-cli](https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli) and [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)  
Also thanks to [@jojoskittlez](https://github.com/jojoskittlez) for letting me use their server ressources 

To get started start the docker containers and visit the webserver to give the transcriber permissions to access your signal data (webserver is served on Port 8080 by default)
